# Soil-fungi-drought
Using deuterium into fatty acid to trace effects of climate change on soil microbial community (within the ClimGrass project). Manuscript title: Soil fungi remain active and invest in storage compounds during drought independent of future climate conditions.

This repository contain data and R script to reproduce the figures associated with this manuscript

1-Water equilibration calculations
Calculating the water equilibration curves and average isotopic enrichment for 18O and 2H R code files to generate the data and associated analyses are available:

Calculate-18O-incorporated.R script to generate supplementary figures and calculate the average values

Calculate-2H-incorporated.R script to generate supplementary figures and calculate the average values

2-Comparison of respiration rates between natural abundance samples and 2H labelled samples
Code to generate the graph and the statistical analysis (including the data set) to test differences in respiration rates between samples subjected to deuterium labelled water vs natural abundance water.

3-Community level mass specific growth, respiration and CUE 
Code and data to generate Fig. 1 and, as well as graphs related to CUE and community level growth

4-Multivariate analysis of mass specific growth rates
Code and data to generate Fig. 2 and multivariate analysis for PLFA abundances in the supplementary file

5-Group comparisons
Compare microbial groups (script and data). Both mass specific growth and abundance, as well as correlation with respiration values.

6-NLFA
R code and data for the figures containing NLFA data
